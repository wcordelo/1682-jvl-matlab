General
-------
JVL and its plot library should compile on any Unix system 
with normal Fortran-77, C, and X-Windows support. 


Build sequence
--------------

1) Build Xplot11 library in  ./plotlib  ...

 % cd plotlib
 % edit Makefile  (set compiler flags for your system)
 % make           (creates libPlt.a)


2) Build Eispack library in ./eispack  ...

 % cd eispack
 % edit Makefile  (set compiler flags for your system)
 % make           (creates eispack.a)


3) Build JVL in ./bin  ...

 % cd bin
 % edit Makefile  (set compiler flags for your system)
 % make jvl


The executable will appear in the bin/ directory.


Documentation
-------------
JVL is backwards-compatible with AVL, and will run usual AVL files 
without jet flaps.  Hence, most of the user info is contained
in the AVL User Guide avl_doc.txt  file.  The only new stuff is
the specification of the jet flap momentum coefficients via
direct or indirect constraints.

If impatient, you can just run JVL in the runs/ directory, 
which contains a simple jet-flap case:

 % cd runs
 % ../bin/jvl wing

OPER
D1 D1 10        ! set wing flap to 10 deg, which also will deflect the jet
J1 J1 5         ! set jet momentum coefficient to CJ = 5
X               ! execute calculation
T               ! plot Trefftz Plane loading
